        AutoSurf was created with people in mind. It&aposs clear that vehicle
        garages take a large amount of the profit from selling cars, and the
        buyer never gets to meet the seller.
      </p>
      <p className="m-10">
        This approach breaks the relationship that we used to have with each
        other when we used to buy/sell vehicles, and at AutoScout we believe
        this relationship is vital for ensuring trust in both parties. Sell your
        car to a person you meet. Buy a car from an owner you know.
